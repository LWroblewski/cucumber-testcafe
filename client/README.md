# TestCafe - cucumberJs

This project has two goals:
1. A library ng-bdd to launch cucumber-js tests using TestCafe, a powerful tool to automate end-to-end web testing. It required nearly no configuration, and is very easy to use.
2. A web app ng-bdd-editor written in Angular to write cucumber tests.
